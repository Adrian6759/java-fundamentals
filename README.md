## Overview
This is going to display the basics of java for my 401 course. This will hold my lab assignments for the next couple of weeks.

## Architecture
Java is mostly being used.

## Credit and Collaborations
Day 1: Some starter code was given by our instructor Alex White and help was provided by instructor for some code. Used Ben Mill's repo for reference for coin flip function. Had everything I needed to solve the problem, just had some code that needed to be deleted and some that just needed to be moved.

Day 2: Collaborated with my classmates and had some help from Rey as well for the testing portion. Sharmarke helped with the function portion. Used code review for reference.

Day 3: Used lab review for reference for resubmit.

Lab 06: Used lab review for reference for resubmit.

Lab 06
Feature Task 1: Create a class to represent a Restaurant. Each Restaurant should have a name, a number of stars between 0 and 5, and a price category.
Implement a Restaurant constructor.

Feature Task 2: Create a class to represent a Review. Each Review should have a body, an author, and a number of stars.

Feature Task 3: A Review should be about a single Restaurant. Choose an implementation for this, and implement it. Some considerations:

Feature Task 4: Add an instance method addReview to your Restaurant class. This method should take in a Review instance, and associate that review with this Restaurant. 

Feature Task 5: When you associate a review with a restaurant, that restaurantâ€™s star rating should change. Ensure that your addReview method updates the Restaurant star rating appropriately, and add tests.
