Architecture
Java is mostly being used.

Credit and Collaborations
Day 1: Some starter code was given by our instructor Alex White and help was provided by instructor for some of the code. Used Ben Mill's repo for reference for coin flip function. Had everything I needed to solve the problem, just had some code that needed to be deleted and some that just needed to be moved.

Day 2: Collaborated with my classmates and had some help from Rey as well for the testing portion. Sharmarke helped with the function portion.
