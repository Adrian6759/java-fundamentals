## Credit and Collaborations
Day 1: Some starter code was given by our instructor Alex White and help was provided by instructor for some code. Used Ben Mill's repo for reference for coin flip function. Had everything I needed to solve the problem, just had some code that needed to be deleted and some that just needed to be moved.
